/r/DailyProgramming challenges. 

In this repository, I will be keeping record of all my /r/DailyProgramming completed programs. The challenges will be completed differently for each difficulty.

Easy
All challenges for easy must be completed with a language I have never used before.

Intermediate
All challenges for intermediate must be completed with a language that I have used little of before. I may try with new languages too, depending on the perceived difficulty.

Hard
All challenges for hard must be completed with a lanaguage that I have been experienced with. The goal is to have languages that I experienced first with a easy difficulty to move into this category over time.
